# Daily Reflection

Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?

## Prompts

- How is today going?

- Not too shabby, mostly just working on the last pieces of the puzzle, ready to be done soon.

- Are you managing your stress?

- Stress is being managed well, taking breaks and talking to people always helps.

- What has you most worried?

- Finishing on time with a good product.
