## Questions

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

- Some benefits of code documenation are to help you in the future! I love this idea and want to do it more, especially with past projects we have worked on with instructors. There are pieces of gold and them and its hard to remember what kind of gold each of them contain.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

- For me personally, it is very important. It saves time and stress in the future. I think it is different for everyone though, depending on how they code and there preference on remembering code.
