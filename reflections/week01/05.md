# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I was a little nervous coming into this week. I wasn't sure how experienced everyone else was going to be at coding along with how fast the course was going to go, but after finishing on Friday, I knew I was right where I belonged. I didn't have any experience coming into this which was hard and scary, but after this first week, with the teachers we have and the super cool class we lucked out with, I know this is going to be an awesome 13 weeks. As far as things I want to get better at, I want to learn more about Flex Box, at this point its trial and error to see if I can get a certain thing in the right place. I also want to get better at design and read about both of these with the articles they provide. All in all, I'm really excited for Monday tomorrow and to continue to learn and understand more about this world.
