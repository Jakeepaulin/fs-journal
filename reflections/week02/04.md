## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

-High quality content is hard to come by and make without having a carefully thought out plan. Along with this, having a plan allows you to stick with it more often than not and not steer away from the game plan to start with. Having a plan before helps in all aspects and taking the time to do so is worth it. However, don't be a perfectionist either.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

-Google haha! But question the solutions you find, because the first solution that pops up may not be the best solution. Our job is not to only find a solution, but the simplest solution.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

- Be picky with your solutions, keep your code simple and clean (it will help in the long run), not obessing over everything, not questioning more oftne but also not reinventing the wheel.
