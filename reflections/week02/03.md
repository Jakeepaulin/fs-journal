## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

-Using inspect and opening up Dev Tools, you can write new information in your console to change the style and code in real time. You should use this to save time so you don't have to go back to VS Code and save changes.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

-The Element Tab allows you to see HTML/CSS. This can be useful to debug HTML because you see the changes in real time without having to flip back and forth between. These won't be saved though so I have to make sure I go back and permanently make the changes I want to VS Code.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

-Printing to the console is a very effective way of debugging code, along with the source tab and using breakpoints.
