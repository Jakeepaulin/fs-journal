## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

-Scope is pretty saying what is available for use for other components.

2. What is Hoisting ?

- This is when variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before execution of the code.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

-I would use let when I want to declare a variable now and in a specific block of code. I would use const when I want a variable to maintain a constant value. I would use var in general and as a default.

Javascript is hard to get at first, knowing what goes where, but I love that the site is now functional.
