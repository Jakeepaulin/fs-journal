## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

-Function Declaration: function name(parameters) {
// statements
}. Function Expression: let name = function(parameters) {
// statements
}
Arrow Function Expression: let name = (parameters) => {
// statements
}

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

-The difference between parameters and arguments is that parameters are used to define a function, while arguments are the values that the parameter gives and the argument receives.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

-Higher order is a function that accepts other functions as parameters and/or returns a function..An example would be "filter.map.reduce".
