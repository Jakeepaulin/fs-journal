## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- Unit Testing: this allows you to test individual pieces of your code.
- Component Testing: this allows you to test components of your vue application that are showing up on the Dom.
- End-To-End (E2E) Testing: tests what happens when users use your application.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- I like E2E testing the most because it addresses the most important issues of why your are actually creating your code.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- I like unit testing the least because it seems the least productive overall.
