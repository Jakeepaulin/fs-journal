## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

- It is a way for others to see your work which can be helpful when looking for a job or growing in some other part of the field.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

- Simple, clean, and effective at showing the skills you are wanting to display.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

- I think I would include Towers and our capstone so far. These both are websites that have enough potential to show people what we are capable of and look good as well.
