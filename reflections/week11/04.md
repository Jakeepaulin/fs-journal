## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- This course has truly been amazing. Coming in with no experience I realize when I talk to others now how much we've actually learned and the trajectory we are on. I couldn't be happier about deciding to do this because not only have I learned something new, but I've met people along the way that I am now, happy to call my friends. I'm excited for this last project and to then move on to whatever is next!
