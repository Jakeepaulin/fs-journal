## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

- In terms of organization, we implemented a lot of scrum practices and technologies including Trello and notes sharing. We did regular stand ups and retrospectives and I thought this really help keep us on the same page.

2. What went well so far?

- Communication across the team, support for another's ideas, and excitement to work together.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

- We could have used our trello better, but overall we had limited merge conflicts.
