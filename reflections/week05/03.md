## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

- Time boxing is being aware of how much time we are giving a certain problem or piece of code. It is easy to get lost in the sauce, and time boxing allows us to be aware of how much time we should give before we find help or take a break.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

- Knowing my golden hour, swallowing the frog first thing, and being flexible are all things I hope to work on. I think mornings are one of my better times of day and that is when I want to tackle the biggest problem first. I also can put my head down a lot of the time and being flexible with new problem solving techniques and schedule changes are things I want to be more ok with.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?

- In lab during the afternoons, I try to time box problems. I don't want to get stuck working on one thing for the entire time, so I give myself a couple attempts at resolving it or an allotted amount of time so that I can move on eventually.
