> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

- The observer pattern seeks to solve the problem of updating parts of a page in response to certain events and the data they provide. This is also in relation to data binding across pages and files.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- The subscribe method, the unsubscribe method, and the broadcast method.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

- From what I understand, I feel like the bcw serve uses the proxy side of things to wrap all the files together where as it also utilizes the observer pattern to notify the subscribing projects and files from the main.
