## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

-Exporting and importing JS files to a main solves the problem of allowing all parts of your code to be accessed. When you just write in all the JS files to your HTML, you lose access and cross talk from them.

2. How does export differ from export default?

-Exports without default tags have their own names, while default exports have the tag of default.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

-Using Module System allows for code to be split into smaller files that are self-contained, performance can be increased, debugging becomes easier in the long run, and ES6 modules allow you to organize the entirety of your code better.
