## Questions

- Callback Hell happens when people try to write JS where execution happens top to bottom visually.

- Asynchronous means take some time, do it in the future. Callbacks are involved by creating an order of functions so that they happen in ways that don't stall the rest of the code.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

- 1. Keep code shallow meaning keep it organized, in small chunks. 2. Modularize meaning right small functions and modules that all have names so there is not large messes that happen. 3. Handle all errors meaning implement error call outs and be prepared for errors to happen always.
