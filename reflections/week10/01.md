## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

- Value type, Reference type, and Pointer type. A value type holds data value within its memory space, while a reference type stores the address in which value can be found, and lastly, pointer types is reference with a \* and points to a reference.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

- A Value-type data type is a value type that holds a data value within its own memory space, directly containing values. Here we don't use let any more, we are just using var.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

- Reference types get stored in memory by storing an address, location, or direction to where the type can be found. This differs from Value Types in that they hold their value directly in their location.
